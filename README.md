# DeviceServer
An alternative to access devices through the browser without any plugin

This is the project resulted from my final year project at Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina.

The project is basically a Rest server, called Device Server, installed in the target computer and then through javascript we can access the modules loaded in the device server.
For proof of concept there is two modules currently implemented, the echo module that just respond the requests with the same message and the Cryptography module that access some supported cryptographic devices.

For more detailed explanation on how this project works see my [final project text](TCC.pdf)(In portuguese).
